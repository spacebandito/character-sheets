# character-sheets
HTML and CSS based character sheet projects

All projects contained are works in progress, with either the goal of introducing new content or improving already existing.

While the main purpose is integration into the Roll20 repository and system, sheets are open for usage in other platforms. If any non HTML projects are introduced, please specify in the subfolder's readme file.

It is highly recommended that you fork your own branch of the repository and commit as a pull request for any edits or potential submissions, instead of directly committing. This will prevent any loss of data or file modification in the event the pull request/commiting of changes is denied or shelved.
